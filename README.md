# GrahamBites 🍪

**GrahamBites** is a front-end website I built as a commission project for a client (Rica) about 3 years ago. The repository contains an **incomplete snapshot** of the project, mostly for reference and front-end practice. The live site demonstrates the design and layout, though some effects may not work due to missing files.
